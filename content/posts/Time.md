What is the definition of time?

Let's see the definition of time scientifically and philosophically!!

### General definition

The scientific definition of the second, which is the Standard International ( [SI](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/International-System-of-Units-SI) ) **unit of time** is “One second is the time that elapses during 9,192,631,770 (9.192631770 x 10 ^9 ) cycles of the radiation produced by the transition between two levels of the cesium 133 atoms”

In essence, that definition means **one second is the amount of observed change that occurs during the “measure stick” of change in cesium 133 atoms,** which means that the concept of time is used to measure rates of change.

### Newton's Definition

Isaac Newton founded classical mechanics on the view that space is distinct from the body and that time passes uniformly without regard to whether anything happens in the world. For this reason, he spoke of absolute space and absolute time, to distinguish these entities from the various ways by which we measure them (which he called relative spaces and relative times).

### Einstein's definition

Einstein started to think about time, the concept of space, and time changed forever. Time is relative and changes based on the observer. The time in the earth is not as same as time on Mars or Jupiter.

### Philosophical Definition

It is defined as *Anadhikala Maya. Time doesn't have a starting nor an end.*
