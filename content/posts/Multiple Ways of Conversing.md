Humans respond based on the command he receives. Based on the conversation the gesture varies, he can respond back, he can show thumbs up, he can nod his head or he can walk.

Now the challenge is how to replicate the same behavior for the robot. The NLP plays a very important role in doing this since voice command is more vital in controlling any robotic device.

We have trained our NLP engine in such a way that it not only responds text but also give physical gesture follows.

2. Do product recommendations.
3. Escort the user enabled by autonomous navigation.
4. Display videos and images.
