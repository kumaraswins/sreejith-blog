Alexa. How is the weather here?

Ok, Google. navigate me to office

Everyone knows that this is the way everyone interacts with the smart device, we need a trigger word to invoke them. Moreover, it will be ever listening and the mic is always going to switch on which is a security threat.

Face detection 

How we are solving this issue. The problem statement is, it has to be intuitive and as well as seamless.

For Mitra, it was solved by doing face detection and proximity sensor. The mic will be enabled only if the user stands in 2 feet of proximity and the user's face should be in the robot's frame. This was a great achievement and complicated engineering problem to solve since, when we say robot people expect it to behave like humans, humans don't need any trigger word to get his attention.
