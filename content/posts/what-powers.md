# Tech behind the blog

Gatsby - Gatsby is a React-based open-source framework by which this is been built.

Why I chose Gatsby - Very popular and lot of plugins and community support 


DNS provider - Godaddy, where I bought my domain name 

Netlify - Hosting service and it is absolutely free for hosting static sites. Gatsby  is very much compatible with Netlify and it is a cake for deploying Gatsby sites on Netlify

Cloudflare - My CNAME is transferred to cloud fare, where I can configure DNS very easily and it gives a wildcard SSL certificate.
